# Advent Of Code 2022

All my advent of code solutions for 2022

This is not my most magnificent nor effecient code since most days i'm gonna be rushing this in between assignments

~~am also going to use a new programming language everday, so again some code won't be great!~~

Dropped that challenge, only using Python and C++ day 12 and onwards due to lack of time
